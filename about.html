<!-- Biography -->
<p><b>I’ll be real--</b> it all started with Xanga and MySpace. I was tinkering with HTML, Photoshop, and copying and pasting code around as a wee 7-year-old. I spent entire days working tirelessly on a layout, just to completely redo it the next day.
<br><br>
    Throughout grade school, <b>you could always count on me to go above and beyond when it came to anything art.</b> I loved drawing, scrapbooking, lettering, and editing photos. Later I got into watercolors, modern calligraphy, and started personalizing whatever I could write on--the creating and crafting never stopped.
<br><br>
    I quickly realized that <b>I had a knack for visual design,</b> but I was never sure what career to pursue with this skill set, because it always felt like a hobby (and also because traditional Asian parents advise against pursuing a career in the arts). So, I graduated from UCSB with a degree in Environmental Studies (because that was the closest thing to a STEM major I can manage). However, this did reinforce my passion for sustainability, and the knowledge and values I gained in this field will always be a huge part of my identity and lifestyle. <b>My passion for our planet and its people is an important part of me </b>and helps me build deep, meaningful relationships wherever I go.
<br><br>
    <b>Now more than ever, </b> our everyday lives depend so heavily on our smart devices and mobile apps. Whether it’s for communication, managing our finances, booking, purchasing, scheduling, ordering, maintaining a certain lifestyle, for some, their livelihood, or purely for entertainment, these apps are updating ever so often, interfaces constantly improving and evolving, companies rebranding and restructuring to fit the needs of users. It occurred to me that with all this digital media to consume, devices to buy, tools to learn and trends to follow, usability and design is everything. Once I realized that something can always look better, work better, and smarter, I knew I had to take part in this thing called “user experience.”
<br><br>
    Once I realized what UX could mean to me and the world, I hastily leapt at the opportunity. <b>My favorite part about UX Design</b> is researching and understanding user insights in order to develop thoughtful, well-designed solutions. Even though I would’ve expected to only enjoy the “design” part of UX, I’ve come to thoroughly appreciate and enjoy collecting user research, building narratives, and conducting usability tests to help guide my design. For me, designing a good user experience is not just about the visual aesthetic (though that part is really fun), but giving users what they need and want to see and what’ll make their lives easier. Pursuing UX design allowed me to hone my artistic talents to provide real solutions and user-centered products. 
<br><br>
    I’m eager to solve problems, improve my UX skills, and create meaningful, useful applications. As a matter of fact, I’m so excited, <b>you should put me to work now!</b> What user research or UX design do you need help with? <a href='mailto:priscilla.vu@aol.com'>Shoot me an email </a> and let’s make some magic happen!
