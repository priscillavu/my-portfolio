        <h1>MyCloud</h1>
        <img src="http://lorempixel.com/350/260/abstract/placeholder-1" alt="Example screens from mycloud">
        <p>MyCloud is a new cloud storage and content creating app that allows easy access, refined organizational features, and provides a safe place to store files. It is the central hub for managing work and/or school assignments, creating and delivering projects, and sharing content with peers and colleagues. Our idea behind this app was to offer a modern, sleek design to help professionals streamline work processes.</p>

            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>1. Users are having a hard time knowing how to access their cloud storage / 2. Users need a tool that can collaborate more universally / 3. Users want to organize content in a more effective way / 4. Users have a hard time locating files </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-2">
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>Once we asked users about the kind of issues they were encountering and what was still needed, it became evident that they were frustrated with organizing and locating files. I focused on creating this app with a modern edge to cater to those users who needed an all-encompassing, user-friendly and highly organizable app that could help business professionals and students with managing files, creating content, and collaborating with peers to deliver clean, impressive projects.</p>

        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>Google Drive’s edge is that it’s easily accessible via web, encompasses sheets, slides and docs, and offers real-time collaborative features. It offers Google Backup and Sync, allowing users to be able to set certain folders to constantly sync onto their Google account's Drive.</p>
        <p>Dropbox’s edge is that it brings files together on the user’s computer and syncs it with other computers and devices. It offers Dropbox Paper, a collaborative document editor, advanced sharing controls, remote wipe, etc.</p>
        <p>OneDrive’s edge is that it saves files and photos and can be accessed any device, anywhere. It also offers real-time collaboration and with Office 365 there are more productivity tools.</p>

    <h2>User Flows to Wireframes</h2>
        <img src="http://lorempixel.com/350/260/abstract/placeholder-1" alt="screenshots of user flows">
        <p>Our user flows break down the processes that are already working in the market. Uploading, creating, and organizing content should be intuitive and familiar. Essentially, we wanted to combine all the functions that already work well for users, so they know exactly what to do when they use MyCloud.</p>
        <img src="http://lorempixel.com/350/260/abstract/placeholder-1" alt="screenshots of user flows">
        <p>The transition from user flow to wireframe was almost seamless, as it was pretty clear what users were used to seeing on their dashboard and what worked for them: one button for adding and creating a piece of content—one place to make something new and amazing to share with the world. One place to upload and store files, that was easily accessible, fast, and friendly. We wanted this to be the central hub for all your important files.</p>

    <h2>Wireframes to High-Fidelity Mockups</h2>
        <p>Referencing our moodboard and MyCloud’s style guide, we developed the high-fidelity mockups with emphasis on consistency and functionality. The addition of icons, buttons, color and graphics did not only bring the app to life but greatly improved user experience. Using the feedback from the initial round of usability testing with the wireframes, we decided on what to add/remove, overall hierarchy, placement of call-to-actions, etc., and did further research with our competitors for direction on page layouts. </p>
